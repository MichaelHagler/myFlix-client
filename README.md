<h1>myFlix-client</h1> 
 
<p>
  Welcome to the myFlix app! This app uses a custom built RESTful API, <a href="https://github.com/MichaelHagler/movie_api">view the reposatory here,</a> and a react bootstrap frontend. The project was built as a SPA(single page application). Users can create, edit, and delete their account. A movie list can be viewed and users can click on individual movies to get more information about them. When viewing a movie, a user will see the title of the movie, the director, and the genre. The movie can be added to a favorites list that can be view on the user's profile page.
